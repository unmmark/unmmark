# Hi, I'm Mark! 👋

I am a marketer in blood, but I've recognized that the small businesses (and not just the small ones, but my audience are them) sometimes doesn't have any online presence, or if they have, its very poor quelity.

Thats why I think, if a business would like to outstand in the online media it requires outstanding website and branding also, and this is where my journey starts. 

I offer unique websites and marketing solutions for small businesses in an accessible price.

I always wanted to learn coding, im kinda coding lover, and this is a huge win in my life that I1ve alreaxy made some products for my clients. 💙
